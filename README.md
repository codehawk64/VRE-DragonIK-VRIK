Current compatible versions for template: Latest Engine Version (Template is not kept to as many compatible versions as the plugin itself).

* Right click on VRExpPluginExample.uproject and switch to your preferred (compatible) engine version.
* If project files did not automatically generate after switching, right click again and select "Generate Visual Studio Files"
* Open Solution and build - Or download the pre-built binary package from the forum thread for the engine version and place into the plugins directory.
* Run
