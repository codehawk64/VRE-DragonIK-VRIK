**Guides for migrating between different engine versions of the plugin:**

View the patch notes at www.vreue4.com for migration guides as well.

**Option 1:**

Go to www.vreue4.com and downloaded the pre-built binary version for the engine version you are using (not updated with every daily change, only weekly or with large patches).

Install it into your ProjectName/Plugins Directory (Engine level hasn't worked since 4.25 or so when it stopped letting me reference other plugins when compiling for that).

**Option 2 (More up to date - preferred if possible):**

* Clone Or Download Zip and extract this repository to a folder named "VRExpansionPlugin" in your "ProjectName/Plugins" directory, create this directory if it is missing.

* Add the VRExpansionPlugin to your projects PublicDependencyModuleNames in the projects build.cs if you have c++ code included.

* IF you do not have c++ code, use the Add New button in the editor and add a blank c++ class to your project.

* Open up the generated project .SLN file and build the project from the build menu.

You need to have visual studio installed and follow the UE4 setup guide for it: https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Development/VisualStudioSetup/
